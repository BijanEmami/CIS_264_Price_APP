Used ASP.NET Framework which connects to SQL server express to create database of all the categories, items, and prices
on a local host computer.  Each main category e.g., Holidays, Textiles, etc... has tables within them
holding values based of alphabetical ordering e.g. A-C, D-G, etc...  Within those, a table is
created to hold all the values contained in categories, item, and price.  These tables have the ability add,
edit, and delete.
