We used ASP.NET MVC Framework so each model has it's own controller and views that we intergrated with 
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The ASP.NET Framework connects to SQL server express to create a database of all the categories, items, and prices
on a local host computer.  Each main category e.g., Holidays, Textiles, etc... has tables within them
holding values based of alphabetical ordering e.g. A-C, D-G, etc...  Within those, a table is
created to hold all the values contained in categories, item, and price.  These tables have the ability add,
edit, and delete. 

The database structure and the data for the database is held in the APP_DATA folder, and is a .mdf file if need for reference.
