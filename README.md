A pricing application that would draw information from a database of product categories and a price list,
so we can quickly locate an item's price as well as have a single repository for up-to-date pricing.

It will have three main screens. The first is a series of buttons that list the product categories.
Once a category is selected, the second screen would have more details by sorting alphabetically.
Once you select one of these buttons, the third screen would have the prices. You can click the
company logo to go back to the home screen as well as a back button at the bottom of the page to go to
the previous screen.

So if you choose textiles, then y-z, then the third screen would list all the different variations of
yarns, zippers, etc. and their prices. In the future there will be the ability to view more details on the items.

There is also a login/logout button which you can use if you want up update the information by
adding a new item, deleting an item, or editing an item. To login simply click the login button
in the top right corner. Once clicked a pop-up box will appear where you can enter a password.
The password is a hard-coded preset string that won't change. When logged in the user will stay
logged in until you click the logout button in the top right corner of the screen.
