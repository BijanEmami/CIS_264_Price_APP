# CIS_264_Price_APP

A pricing application that would draw off of a database of product categories and a price list, 
so we can quickly locate a price as well as have a singe repository for up-to-date pricing. 

It will have three screens. The first is a series of buttons that list the product categories. 
Once a category is selected, then the second screen would have more details by sorting alphabetically. 
Once you select one of these buttons, then the third screen would have the prices. 

So if you choose textiles, then y-z, then the third screen would list all the different variations of yarns, zippers, etc. and their prices. 
After that there would be a return button to the first screen or a back button to the last screen. 
We would also need to be able to change the items on each screen and the prices as needed.
